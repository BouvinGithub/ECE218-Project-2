This is the code for our headlight system. It is able to turn the car engine on and off
based on the ignition button and whether the driver sitting button is pressed. If the engine
is on then the headlights will be controlled by a dial with three positions: ON/OFF/AUTO.
The first two are self explanitory, ON means the headlights are on, and OFF means the headlights
are off. The AUTO position means that the car decides whether the headlights should be on or off
based on the ambient light levels.
